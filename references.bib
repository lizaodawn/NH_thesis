It also aims to take Pliny seriously in his own right and shows a few characteristics of his language in the light of his general aims. Pliny's work covers a broad range of topics, some of which were more accessible for his audience than others, some of which were known in more detail in his time than others, and some of which human participants were more involved than in others. Although Pliny clearly views nature from the perspective of its significance for human beings, his text is nevertheless the largest work in Latin that is not chiefly anthropocentric in its subject matter, and therefore a welcome source for statistically 'deviant' linguistic structures. The chapter then addresses a few features of Pliny's language that are not, or are less, determined by his subject matter. The overall organization of the material is very careful, down to the smallest detail.},

Comum, at the southern end of Lake Larius (modern Lago di Como), had been an obscure Celtic village until a century previously, when the Romans established a presence there. Virtually nothing is known about Pliny’s youth or education, but by ad 47 he had embarked on an equestrian military career in Germania under the command of Cn. Domitius Corbulo. He had returned to Rome by the ad 50s, and seems to have remained relatively obscure during the principate of Nero. But with the accession of Vespasian – whom he already knew – in ad 69 he returned to public service and became a procurator (financial officer), with positions in various locations, including Narbonensis, Tarraconensis, Belgica, Africa, and perhaps elsewhere. He became a close advisor to the emperor, confering with him on a daily basis when in Rome. He also practiced law. Eventually he became fleet commander at Misenum, the Roman naval base established by Augustus at the end of the long peninsula that forms the western side of the Bay of Naples.

Quantitative and computational text technologies provide a methodology that help us understand the nature of this monumental compendium of scientific knowledge from the Roman Empire and allow us to answer specific questions such as the nature of sources that were used, the interrelations of the topics covered in the text, and the ways that these topics have been adopted or reflected in the publication history of the work.  This paper explores the ways that other scholars and editors have tried to make this massive work more manageable, and then talk about the ways that network analysis and other quantitative approaches can help us understand the sources that Pliny used when writing his work.},

	isbn = {978-0-203-42690-6},
	abstract = {Landscapes in Pliny? On initial consideration the possibility is 
unlikely. His frenetic lifestyle can have left little time for gazing 
at the view. This impression is compounded by the Historia natu
ralis. Here the author states clearly his belief that nature’s artistry 
is nowhere more spectacularly manifest than in her smallest and 
least regarded creations (11. 1-4).1 Thus he pledges himself to 
examine every detail of the natural world; and the result is an 
itemization of the various components of nature rather than an 
overview of their wider context. It is his zeal in performing his 
task, holding even the common housefly up for the close inspec­
tion of his readers, that ensures that Pliny has his vision fixed at 
close range. Seldom does he step back to admire a wider vista, 
unless the subject under consideration is itself on a large scale. 
Trees, rivers, and mountains are thus the individual components 
of nature which most frequently figure in the context of their wider 
environment. Yet, overall, these three features do offer a reason­
able number of what may be termed landscape portrayals, and 
the passages examined in the course of this paper will, for the 
most part, be focused on them. The comparative wealth of refer­
ences to such ‘parts of nature’ in isolation is also of considerable 
value in assessing Pliny’s reaction to the wider view. The wholepicture, as it were, emerges when both types of observation are 
placed against the backdrop of Pliny’s philosophical concept of 
the natural world.},
