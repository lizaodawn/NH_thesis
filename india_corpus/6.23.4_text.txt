after passing this island, the other side of the indus is occupied, as we know by clear and undoubted proofs, by the athoae, the bolingae, the gallitalutae, the dimuri, the megari, the ardabae, the mesae, and after them, the uri and the silae; beyond which last there are desert tracts, extending a distance of two hundred and fifty miles. after passing these nations, we come to the organagae, the abortae, the bassuertae, and, after these last, deserts similar to those previously 'mentioned. we then come to the peoples of the sorofages, the arbae, the marogomatrae, the umbrittae, of whom there are twelve nations, each with two cities, and the asini, a people who dwell in three cities, their capital being bucephala, which was founded around the tomb of the horse belonging to king alexander, which bore that name. above these peoples there are some mountain tribes, which lie at the foot of caucasus, the soseadae and the sondrae, and, after passing the indus and going down its stream, the samarabriae, the sambraceni, the bisambritae, the orsi, the anixeni, and the taxilae, with a famous city, which lies on a low but level plain, the general name of the district being amenda: there are four nations here, the peucolaitae, the arsagalitae, the geretae, and the assoi.
