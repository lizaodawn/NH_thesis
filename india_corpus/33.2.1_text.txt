gold is dug out of the earth and in proximity to it gold-solder, which still retains in greek a name derived from gold, so as to make it appear more precious. it was not enough to have discovered one bane to plague life, without setting value even on the corrupt humours of gold! avarice was seeking for silver, but counted it a gain to have discovered cinnabar by the way, and devised a use to make of red earth. alas for the prodigality of our inventiveness! in how many ways have we raised the prices of objects! the art of painting has come in addition, and we have made gold and silver dearer by means of engraving! man has learnt to challenge nature in competition! the enticements of the vices have augmented even art: it has pleased us to engrave scenes of licence upon our goblets, and to drink through the midst of obscenities. afterwards these were flung aside and began to be held of no account, when there was an excess of gold and silver. out of the same earth we dug supplies of fluorspar and crystal, things which their mere fragility rendered costly. it came to be deemed the proof of wealth, the true glory of luxury, to possess something that might be absolutely destroyed in a moment. nor was this enough: we drink out of a crowd of precious stones, and set our cups with emeralds, we take delight in holding india for the purpose of tippling, and gold is now a mere accessory.
