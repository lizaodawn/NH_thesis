no description of the 'memnonia,' or 'stone of memnon,' exists. as for the 'media,' a black stone found by the media who is so famous in legend, it has veins of a golden-yellow colour, exudes saffron-yellow moisture and reproduces the flavour of wine. the 'meconitis,' or 'poppy stone,' closely resembles the poppy. 'mithrax' comes from persia and the mountains of the persian gulf. it is a stone of many colours and reflects their changing tints in sunlight. 'morochthos' is leek-green in colour and exudes milky moisture. 'mormorion,' a very dark translucent stone from india, is also known as 'promnion'; but it is called 'alexandrion,' or 'alexander stone,' when the colour of garnet is mingled with it, and 'cyprium,' when that of carnelian is present. it is found also at tyre and in galatia and, according to xenocrates, occurs as well close to the alps. these are gems which are eminently suitable for cameo-engraving. the 'myrrhitis,' or 'myrrh stone,' has the colour of myrrh and an appearance quite unlike that of a gemstone. it smells like an unguent and, when rubbed, even like spikenard. the 'black myrmecias,' or 'wart stone,' has excrescences like warts, while the 'myrsinitis,' or 'myrtle stone,' is honey-coloured and has the scent of myrtle. a stone is 'mesoleucos,' or 'white in the middle,' when a white band marks the middle of the gem; and is 'mesomelas,' or 'black in the middle,' when a black layer intersects a gem of any colour in the middle.
