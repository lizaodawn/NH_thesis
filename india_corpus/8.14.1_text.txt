megasthenes writes that in india snakes grow so large as to be able to swallow stags and bulls whole; and metrodorus that in the neighbourhood of the river rhyndacus in pontus they catch and gulp down birds passing over them even though they are flying high and fast. there is the well-known case of the snake 120 ft. long that was killed during the punic wars on the river bagradasa by general regulus, using ordnance and catapults just as if storming a town; its skin and jawbones remained in a temple at rome down to the numantine war? credibility attaches to these stories on account of the serpents in italy called boas, which reach such dimensions that during the principate of claudius of blessed memory a whole child was found in the belly of one that was killed on the vatican hill. their primary food is milk sucked from a cow; from this they derive their name.
