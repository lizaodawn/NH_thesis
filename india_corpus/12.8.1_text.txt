we have already described the wool-bearing trees of the chinese in making mention of that race, and we have spoken of the large size of the trees in india. one of those peculiar to india, the ebony, is spoken of in glowing terms by virgil, who states that it does not grow in any other country. herodotus, however, prefers it to be ascribed to ethiopia, stating that the ethiopians used to pay as tribute to the kings of persia every three years a hundred logs of ebony, together with gold and ivory. nor also should we omit the fact, since that author indicates it, that the ethiopians used to pay twenty large elephant tusks on the same account. so high was the esteem in which ivory was held in the 310th year of our city, the date at which that author composed his history at thurii in italy; which makes all the more surprising the statement which we accept on his authority, that nobody of asia or greece had hitherto been seen who had ever seen the river po. the exploration of the geography of ethiopia, which as we have said had lately been reported to the emperor nero, showed that over a space of 1,996 miles from syene on the frontier of the empire to meroe trees are rare, and there are none except of the palm species. that is possibly the reason why ebony was the third most important item in the tribute paid.
