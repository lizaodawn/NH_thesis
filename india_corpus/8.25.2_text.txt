hyrcania and india produce the tiger, au animal of terrific speed, which is most noticeable when the whole of its litter, which is always numerous, is being captured. the litter is taken by a man lying in wait with the swiftest horse obtainable, and is transferred successively to fresh horses. but when the mother tiger finds the lair empty (for the males do not look after their young) she rushes off at headlong speed, tracking them by scent. the captor when her roar approaches throws away one of the cubs. she snatches it up in her mouth, and returns and resumes the pursuit at even a faster pace owing to her burden, and so on in succession until the hunter has regained the ship and her ferocity rages vainly on the shore.
