the river jomanes runs into the ganges through the territory of the palibothri, between the cities of methora and chrysobora. in the regions which lie to the south of the ganges, the people are tinted by the heat of the sun, so much so as to be quite coloured, but yet not burnt black, like the aethiopians. the nearer they approach the indus, the deeper their colour, a proof of the heat of the climate. after leaving the nation of the prasii, we immediately come to the indus; in the mountains of the prasii a race of pygmies is said to exist. artemidorus says that between these two rivers there is a distance of two thousand one hundred miles.
