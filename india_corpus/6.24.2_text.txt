thus much we learn from the ancient writers; it has fallen to our lot, however, to obtain a still more accurate knowledge of these people; for during the reign of the emperor claudius, an embassy came from even this distant island to rome. the circumstances under which this took place were as follow: annius plocamus had farmed from the treasury the revenues arising from the red sea. a certain freedman of his, while sailing around arabia, was carried away by a gale from the north beyond the coast of carmania. in the course of fifteen days he had drifted to hippuros, a port of taprobane, where he was most kindly and hospitably received by the king; and having, after a study of six months, become well acquainted with the language, was enabled to answer all his enquiries relative to the romans and their emperor. but of all that he heard, the king was more particularly struck with surprise at our rigid notions of justice, on ascertaining that among the money found on the captive, the denarii were all of equal weight, although the different figures on them plainly showed that they had been struck in the reigns of several emperors. by this circumstance in especial, the king was prompted to form an alliance with the romans, and accordingly sent to rome an embassy, consisting of four persons, the chief of whom was itachias.
