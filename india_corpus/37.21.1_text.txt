beryls differ very little, and also very considerably, from opals, stones which yield precedence only to the 'smaragdus.' india, likewise, is the sole producer of these stones and combining, as they do, the brilliant qualities of the most valuable gems, they above all others description. they display the more subtle fires of the 'carbunculus,' the flashing purple of the amethyst and the sea-green tint of the 'smaragdus,' all combined together in incredible brilliance. for some people the vivid colours resemble in their general effect the pigment known as azurite; for others, the flames from burning sulphur or from a fire that has been kindled with olive oil. the size of the stone is that of a hazel nut. even among us history makes it famous, since there still exists even today a precious stone of this variety which caused antony to outlaw a senator, nonius, the son of the nonius struma who made the poet catullus so indignant when he saw him seated in the magistrate's chair, and the grandfather of servilius nonianus, who was consul in my time. this nonius, when outlawed, fled, taking with him this ring alone of all his many possessions. there is no doubt that at that time the value of the ring was 2,000,000 sesterces; but how amazing was antony's savagery and extravagant caprice in outlawing a man for the sake of a gemstone, and, equally, how extraordinary was the obstinacy of nonius in clinging to his 'doom,' when even wild creatures are believed to buy their safety by biting off the member which, as they know, endangers their lives, and leaving it behind for their pursuers!
