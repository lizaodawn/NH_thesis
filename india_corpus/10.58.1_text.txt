above all, birds imitate the human voice, parrots indeed actually talking. india sends us this bird; its name in the vernacular is siptaces; its whole body is green, only varied by a red circlet at the neck. it greets its masters and repeats words given to it, being particularly sportive over the wine. its head is as hard as its beak; and when it is being taught to speak it is beaten on the head with an iron rod â€” otherwise it does not feel blows. when it alights from flight it lands on its beak, and it leans on this and so reduces its weight for the weakness of its feet.
