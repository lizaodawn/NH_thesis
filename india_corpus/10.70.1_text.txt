the pegasus bird with a horse's head and the griffin with ears and a terrible hooked beak â€” the former said to be found in scythia and the latter in ethiopia judge to be fabulous; and for my own part i think the same about the bearded eagled attested by a number of people, a bird larger than an eagle, having curved horns on the temples, in colour a rusty red, except that its head is purple-red. nor should the sirens obtain credit, although dinon the father of the celebrated authority clitarchus declares that they exist in india and that they charm people with their song and then when they are sunk in a heavy sleep tear them in pieces. anybody who would believe that sort of thing would also assuredly not deny that snakes by licking the ears of the augur melampus gave him the power to understand the language of birds, or the story handed down by democritus, who mentions birds from a mixture of whose blood a snake is born, whoever eats which will understand the conversations of birds, and the things that he records about one crested lark in particular, as even without these stories life is involved in enormous uncertainty with respect to auguries. homer mentions a kind of bird called the scops; many people speak of its comic dancing movements when it is watching for its prey, but i cannot easily grasp these in my mind, nor are the birds themselves now known. consequently a discussion of admitted facts will be more profitable.
