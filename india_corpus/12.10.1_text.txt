in india there is also a thorn the wood of which resembles ebony, but can be detected even by the flame of a lantern, as the light at once shines through people. the tree is called the pala, and the fruit ariena. it is most frequent in the territory of the sydraci, which was the farthest point reached by the expeditions of alexander. there is also another tree resembling this one, the fruit of which is sweeter, but causes derangement of the bowels. alexander issued an order in advance forbidding any member of his expedition to touch it.
