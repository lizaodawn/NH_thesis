with this stone is associated, but more closely in respect of similarity in appearance than of esteem, the pale-green 'callaina.' it occurs in the hinterland beyond india among the inhabitants of the caucasus, the hyrcani, sacae and dahae. it is of exceptional size, but is porous and full of flaws. a far purer and finer stone is found in cannania. in both localities, however, 'callaina' occurs amidst inaccessible icy crags, where it is seen as an eye-shaped swelling loosely adhering to the rocks, as though it had been attached to them, rather than formed upon them. thus tribes accustomed to riding on horseback and too lazy to use their feet find it irksome to climb in search of the stones; and they are also deterred by the risks. they, therefore, shoot at them from a distance with their slings and dislodge them, moss and all. this is the article that pays their taxes, this they acknowledge to be the most beautiful thing that can be worn on neck or fingers, from this they derive their wealth, this is their pride and joy as they boast of the number that they have shot down since their childhood, an operation in which success varies, seeing that some win fine stones with their first shot, while many reach old age without obtaining one. such, then, is the way in which they hunt the 'callaina.' subsequently, the stone is shaped by the drill, being in other respects an easy stone to deal with. the best stones have the colour of 'smaragdus,' so that it is obvious, after all, that their attractiveness is not their own. they are enhanced by being set in gold, and no gem sets off gold so well. the finer specimens lose their colour if they are touched by oil, unguents or even undiluted wine, whereas the less valuable ones preserve it more steadfastly. no gemstone is more easily counterfeited by means of imitations in glass. some authorities say that 'callainae' are found in arabia inside the nests of the birds known as 'melancoryphi,' or 'black caps.'
