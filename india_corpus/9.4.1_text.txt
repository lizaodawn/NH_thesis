an embassy from olisipo sent for the purpose reported to the emperor tiberius that a triton had been seen and heard playing on a shell in a certain cave, and that he had the well-known shape. the description of the nereids also is not incorrect, except that their body is bristling with hair even in the parts where they have human shape; for a nereid has been seen on the same coast, whose mournful song moreover when dying has been heard a long way off by the coast-dwellers; also the governor of gaul wrote to the late lamented augustus that a large number of dead nereids were to be seen on the shore. i have distinguished members of the order of knighthood as authorities for the statement that a man of the sea has been seen by them in the gulf of cadiz, with complete resemblance to a human being in every part of his body, and that he climbs on board ships during the hours of the night and the side of the vessel that he sits on is at once weighed down, and if he stays there longer actually goes below the water. during the rule of tiberius, in an island off the coast of the province of lugdunum the receding ocean tide left more than 300 monsters at the same time, of marvellous variety and size, and an equal number on the coast of saintes, and among the rest elephants, and rams with only a white streak to resemble horns, and also many nereids. turranius has stated that a monster was cast ashore on the coast at cadiz that had 24 feet of tail-end between its two fins, and also 120 teeth, the biggest 9 inches and the smallest 6 inches long. the skeleton of the monster to which andromeda in the story was exposed was brought by marcus scaurus from the town of jaffa in judaea and shown at rome among the rest of the marvels during his aedileship; it was 40 ft. long, the height of the ribs exceeding the elephants of india, and the spine being 1 ft. 6 inches thick.
