but whoever first discovered how to cut marble and carve up luxury into many portions was a man of misplaced ingenuity. the cutting of the marble is effected apparently by iron, but actually by sand, for the saw merely presses the sand upon a very thinly traced line, and then the passage of the instrument, owing to the rapid movement to and fro, is in itself enough to cut the stone. the ethiopian variety of this sand is the most highly esteemed; for, to make matters worse, material for cutting marble is sought from as far afield as ethiopia; and, moreover, men go in search of it even to india, which it was once an affront to strict morality to visit even for pearls. the indian is the next most highly praised, but the ethiopian is finer and cuts without leaving any roughness. the indian does not give the stone such a smooth surface. however, people engaged in polishing marble are strongly recommended to rub marble with it when it has been calcined. there is a similar fault in the naxian sand and in that of coptos, which is known as the egyptian variety. these were the kinds used for cutting marble in early times. later there was discovered an equally valuable sand from a sandbank in the adriatic which is uncovered only at low tide. consequently, its position is not easy to mark. now also fraudulent craftsmen dare to cut slabs with any kind of sand from any river, a waste which very few clients perceive. for in fact the coarser the sand, the less accurate the sections it grinds, the more marble it wears away, and owing to the rough surfaces produced, the more work it leaves for those responsible for polishing the slabs. hence the cut slabs are made thinner. again, for polishing marble, sand from the thebaid is suitable, as well as powder made from limestone or pumice.
