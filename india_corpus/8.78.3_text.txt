wild pigs breed once a year. the boars are very rough when mating; at this period they fight each other, hardening their flanks by rubbing against trees and plastering their behinds with mud. the females are fiercer when with young, and this is more or less the same in every kind of wild animal. male boats do not mate till one year old. in india they have curved tusks 18 in. long: two project from the jaw, and two from the forehead like a calf's horns. the wild boar's hair is a sort of copper colour; that of the other species is black. but the hog genus does not occur in arabia.
