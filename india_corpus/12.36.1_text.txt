consequently indian myrrh passes over into mastich, which is also obtained from a thorn in india, and in arabia as well; it is called laina. of mastich also there are two kinds, since in asia and greece there is also found a plant sending out from its root leaves and a prickly head like an apple, full of seed and of juice which spurts out when an incision is made in the top, so that it can scarcely be distinguished from true mastich. moreover, there is also a third kind in pontus which is more like bitumen; but the kind most highly praised is the white mastich of chios, which fetches a price of 10 denarii a pound, while the black kind costs 2 denarii. it is said that the chian mastich exudes from the lentisk like a kind of gum. like frankincense it is adulterated with resin.
