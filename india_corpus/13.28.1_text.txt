ethiopia, which is on the borders of egypt, has virtually no remarkable trees except the wool-tree, like the one described among the trees of india and arabia. however, the ethiopian variety has a much woollier consistency, and a larger pod, like that of a pomegranate, and also the trees themselves resemble each other. beside the wool-tree there are also palms of the kind which we have described. the trees and the scented forests of the islands round the coast of ethiopia have been spoken of when those islands were mentioned.
