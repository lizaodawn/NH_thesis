in this island no slavery exists; they do not prolong their sleep today-break, nor indeed during any part of the day; their buildings are only of a moderate height from the ground; the price of corn is always the same; they have no courts of law and no litigation. hercules is the deity whom they worship; sabtul and their king is chosen by the people, an aged man always, distinguished for his mild and clement disposition, and without children. if after he has been elected king, he happens to become the father of children, his abdication is the consequence; this is done that there may be no danger of the sovereign power becoming hereditary. thirty advisers are provided for him by the people, and it is only by the advice of the majority of them that any man is condemned to capital punishment. even then, the person so condemned has a right of appealing to the people, in which case a jury consisting of seventy persons is appointed. should these acquit the accused, the thirty counsellors are no longer held in any estimation, but are visited with the greatest disgrace. the king wears the costume of father liber, while the rest of the people dress like the natives of arabia. the king, if he is found guilty of any offence, is condemned to death; but no one slays him; all turn their backs upon him, and refuse to hold any communication or even discourse with him. their festivals are celebrated with the chase, the most valued sports being the pursuit of the tiger and the elephant. the lands are carefully tilled; the vine is not cultivated there, but of other fruits there is great abundance. they take great delight in fishing, and especially in catching turtles; beneath the shells of which whole families find an abode, of such vast size are they to be found. these people look upon a hundred years as a comparatively short life. thus much have we learned respecting taprobane.
