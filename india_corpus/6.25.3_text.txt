below all these countries, is the line of coast which we come to after leaving the indus. ariana is a region parched by the sun and surrounded by deserts; still, however, as the face of the country is every here and there diversified with well-shaded spots, it finds communities grouped together to cultivate it, and more especially around the two rivers, known as the tonberos and the arosapes. there is also the town of artacoana, and the river arius, which flows past alexandria, a city founded by alexander; this place is thirty stadia in extent. much more beautiful than it, as well as of much greater antiquity, is artacabane, fortified a second time by antiochus, and fifty stadia in breadth. we then come to the nation of the dorisdorsigi, and the rivers pharnaracotis, and ophradus; and then to prophthasia, a city of the zaraspades, the drangae, the evergetae, the zarangae, and the gedrusi; the towns of pucolis, lyphorta, the desert of the methorgi, the river manais, the nation of the acutri, the river eorum, the nation of the orbi, the pomanus, a navigable river in the territories of the pandares, the apirus in the country of the suari, with a good harbour at its mouth, the city of condigramma, and the river cophes; into which last flow the navigable streams of the saddaros, the parospus, and the sodanus. some writers will also have it that daritis forms part of ariana, and give the length of them both as nineteen hundred and fifty miles, and the breadth one half of that of india. others again have spread the gedrusi and the pasires over an extent of one hundred and thirty-eight miles, and place next to them the ichthyophagi oritae, a people who speak a language peculiar to themselves, and not the indian dialect, extending over a space of two hundred miles. alexander forbade the whole of the ichthyophagi to live any longer on fish. next after these the writers have placed extensive deserts, and then carmania, persia, and arabia.
