next in value in our estimation come the pearls of india and arabia, which we discussed in book 9 [106] among the products of the sea. the third rank among gemstones is assigned for several reasons to the 'smaragdus.' certainly, no colour has a more pleasing appearance. for although we gaze eagerly at young plants and at leaves, we look at 'smaragdi' with all the more pleasure because, compared with them, there is nothing whatsoever that is more intensely green. moreover, they alone of gems, when we look at them intently, satisfy the eye without cloying it. indeed, even after straining our sight by looking at another object, we can restore it to its normal state by looking at a 'smaragdus'; and engravers of gemstones find that this is the most agreeable means of refreshing theft eyes: so soothing to their feeling of fatigue is the mellow green colour of the stone. apart from this property, 'smaragdi' appear larger when they are viewed at a distance because they reflect their colour upon the air around them? they remain the same in sunlight, shadow or lamplight, always shining gently and allowing the vision to penetrate to their further extremity owing to the ease with which light passes through them, a property that pleases us also in respect of water. 'smaragdi' are generally concave in shape, so that they concentrate the vision. because of these properties, mankind has decreed that 'smaragdi' must be preserved in their natural state and has forbidden them to be engraved. in any case, those of scythia and egypt are so hard as to be unaffected by blows. when 'smaragdi' that are tabular in shape are laid flat, they reflect objects just as mirrors do. the emperor nero used to watch the fights between gladiators in a reflecting 'smaragdus.'
