about the leaf, which is that of the nard, it is proper to speak at greater length, as it holds a foremost place among perfumes. the nard is a shrub, the root of which is heavy and thick but short and black, and although oily, brittle; it has a musty smell like the gladius, and an acrid taste; the leaves are small, and grow in clusters. the shoots of the nard sprout into ears, and consequently both the spikes and the leaves of the nard are famous â€” a two-fold product. another kind of nard growing by the ganges is entirely ruled out by its name, 'putrid nard,' having a poisonous smell. nard is also adulterated with a plant called bastard nard, which grows everywhere, and has a thicker and broader leaf and a sickly colour inclining to white; and also by being mixed with its own root to increase the weight, and with gum and silver-spume or antimony and gladiolus or husk of gladiolus. unadulterated nard can be detected by its light weight and its ruddy colour and sweet scent and particularly by its taste, which dries up the mouth and leaves a pleasant flavour.
