their name for this tree is the gossypinus; it also grows in greater abundance on the smaller island of tyros, which is ten miles distant from the other. juba says that this shrub has a woolly down poring round it, the fabric made from which is superior to the linen of india. he also says that there is an arabian tree called the cynas from which cloth is made, which has foliage resembling a palm-leaf. similarly the natives of india are provided with clothes by their own trees. but in the tyros islands there is also another tree with a blossom like a white violet but four times as large; it has no scent, which may well surprise us in that region of the world.
