adjoining india is the bactrian country, in which is produced the highly esteemed bdellium. the tree is black in colour, and the size of the olive; its leaf resembles that of the oak and its fruit that of the wild fig. the subsistence of the fruit is like gum; one name for it is brochos, another malacha, and another maldaeos, while a black variety which is rolled up into cakes has the name of hadrobolos. it ought to be transparent like wax, to have a scent, to exude grease when crumbled, and to have a bitter taste, though without acidity. when used in religions ritual it is steeped in wine, which makes its scent more powerful. this tree is native to arabia and india, and also to media and babylon. some people give to the bdellium imported from media the name of peraticum; this kind is more brittle and also harder and more bitter than the others, whereas the indian sort is moister, and gummy. almonds are used to adulterate indian bdellium, but all the other sorts are adulterated also with the bark of scordastum, that being the name of a tree that resembles the gum. but these adulterations can be detected — and it must be enough to state this once for all, to apply to all other perfumes as well — by smell, colour, weight, taste and the action of fire. the bactrian bdellium is shiny and dry, and has a number of white spots like fingernails; and also it has a specific weight of its own and ought not to be heavier or lighter than this. the price of pure bdellium is 3 denarii a pound.
