but more famous and more powerful than any nation, not only in these regions, but throughout almost the whole of india, are the prasii, who dwell in a city of vast extent and of remarkable opulence, called palibothra; from which circumstance some writers have given to the people themselves the name of palibothri, and, indeed, to the whole tract of country between the ganges and the indus. these people keep on daily pay in their king's service an army, consisting of six hundred thousand foot, thirty thousand horse, and nine thousand elephants, from which we may easily form a conjecture as to the vast extent of their resources. behind these people, and lying still more in the interior, are the monedes, and the suari, among whom is a mountain known as maleus, upon which the shadow falls to the north in winter, and to the south in summer, six months alternately. in this district the constellation of the greater bear is seen at only one period in the year, and then but for fifteen days, according to what baeton states. megasthenes, however, informs us that the same is the case also in many other localities of india. the south pole is by the indians called diamasa.
