ebony was exhibited at rome by pompey the great on the occasion of his triumph over mithridates. according to fabius ebony does not give out a flame, yet burns with an agreeable scent. it is of two kinds: the better one, which grows as a tree, is rare â€” it is of a smooth substance and free from knots, and of a shiny black colour that is pleasing to the eye even in the natural state without the aid of art; whereas the other grows as a shrub like the cytisus, and is spread over the whole of india.
