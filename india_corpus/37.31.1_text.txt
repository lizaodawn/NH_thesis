on the contrary, sard, which shares a part of its name with sardonyx, is extremely useful for this purpose. the stone itself is a common one and was first discovered at sardis, but the most valuable specimens are found near babylon. when certain quarries are being opened up the stones come to light adhering to the rock like heart-wood. this mineral is said to be now exhausted in persia, but sards are found in several other localities, for example in paros and at assos. in india it occurs in three varieties: there are red stones, those known as 'pioniae,' or 'fatty stones,' because of their greasy lustre, and finally a third kind that is backed with silver foil. the indian stones are translucent, whereas the arabian are somewhat opaque. others are found also in epirus near leucas and in egypt; and these are backed with gold foil. among sards too there are male and female stones, of which the former shine the more intensely, while the latter are less lively and have a duller lustre. in ancient times no gemstone was more commonly used than the sard — this, at any rate, is the gem that is flaunted in the plays of menander and philemon — and no other translucent gems lose their lustre less readily when they are covered with moisture: olive oil affects them more than any other liquid. of these stones, the honey-coloured meet with disapproval, which is even stronger in the case of those that look like earthenware.
