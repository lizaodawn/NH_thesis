it is said that ivy now grows in asia minor. theophrastus about 314 bc. had stated that it did not grow there, nor yet in india except on mount meros, and indeed that harpalus had used every effort to grow it in media without success, while alexander had come back victorious from india with his army wearing wreaths of ivy, because of its rarity, in imitation of father liber; and it is even now used at solemn festivals among the peoples of thrace to decorate the wands of that god, and also the worshippers' helmets and shields, although it is injurious to all trees and plants and destructive to tombs and walls, and very agreeable to chilly snakes, so that it is surprising that any honour has been paid to it.
