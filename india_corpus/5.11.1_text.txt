the cities of egypt: egypt, besides its boast of extreme antiquity, asserts that it contained, in the reign of king amasis, 20,000 inhabited cities: in our day they are still very numerous, though no longer of any particular note. still however we find the following ones mentioned as of great renown â€” the city of apollo; next, that of leucothea; then great diospolis, otherwise thebes, known to fame for its hundred gates; coptos, which from its proximity to the nile, forms its nearest emporium for the merchandise of india and arabia; then the city of venus, and then another of city of jupiter. after this comes tentyris, below which is abydus, the royal abode of memnon, and famous for a temple of osiris, which is situate in libya, at a distance from the river of seven miles and a half. next to it comes ptolemais, then panopolis, and then another city of venus, and, on the libyan side, lycon, where the mountains form the boundary of the province of thebais. on passing these, we come to the city of mercury, alabastron, city of dogs, and city of hercules already mentioned. we next come to arsinoe, and memphis, which has been previously mentioned; between which last and the nome of arsinoites, upon the libyan side, are the towers known as the pyramids, the labyrinth on lake moeris, in the construction of which no wood was employed, and the town of crialon. besides these, there is one place in the interior, on the confines of arabia, of great celebrity, the city of the sun.
