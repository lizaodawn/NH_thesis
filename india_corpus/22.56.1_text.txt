the uses that wax can be put to in combination with other substances would more than fill a pharmacopoeia, and the same is true of other materials that combine usefully with others. these, as i have said, are due to man's ingenuity. wax salves, poultices, plasters, eye-salves, antidotes, were not made by the divine mother who created the universe: they are the inventions of the laboratory, or more correctly of human greed. nature indeed brings forth her works absolutely perfect; a few ingredients arc chosen a with a purpose, not by guesswork, so that dry substances may be modified by some fluid to facilitate their passage, or moist things by a more substantial body to give the required consistency. but for a man to weigh out, scruple by scruple, the active ingredients that he gathers together and blends, is not human guesswork but human impudence. i myself shall not touch upon drugs imported from india and arabia or from the outer world. ingredients that grow so far away are unsatisfactory for remedies; they are not produced for us, nay, not even for the natives who in that case would not sell them. let them be bought if you like to make perfumes, unguents and luxuries, or even in the name of religion, for we worship the gods with frankincense and costmary. but health i shall prove to be independent of such drugs, if only to make luxury all the more ashamed of itself.
