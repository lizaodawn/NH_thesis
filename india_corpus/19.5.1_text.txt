an attempt has been made to dye even linen so as to adapt it for our mad extravagance in clothes. this was first done in the fleets of alexander the great when he was voyaging on the river indus, his generals and captains having held a sort of competition even in the various colours of the ensigns of their ships; and the river banks gazed in astonishment as the breeze filled out the bunting with its shifting hues. cleopatra had a purple sail when she came with mark antony to actium, and with the same sail she fled. a purple sail was subsequently the distinguishing mark of the emperor's ship.
