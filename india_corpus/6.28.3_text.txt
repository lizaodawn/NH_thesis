beyond their district, in the direction of india, is said to be the desert island of caicandrus, fifty miles out at sea; near to which, with a strait flowing between them, is stoidis, celebrated for its valuable pearls. after passing the promontory are the armozei, joining up to the carmani; some writers, however, place between them the arbii, extending along the shore a distance of four hundred and twenty-one miles. here is a place called portus macedonum, and the altars of alexander, situate on a promontory, besides the rivers saganos, daras, and salsa. beyond the last river we come to the promontory of themisteas, and the island of aphrodisias, which is peopled. here persis begins, at the river oratis, which separates it from elymais. opposite to the coast of persis, are the islands of psilos, cassandra, and aracia, the last sacred to neptune, and containing a mountain of great height. persis itself, looking towards the west, has a line of coast five hundred and fifty miles in length; it is a country opulent even to luxury, but has long since changed its name for that of "parthia." i shall now devote a few words to the parthian empire.
