the olive-tree of india is barren, except for the fruit of the wild olive. but trees resembling our junipers that bear pepper occur everywhere, although some writers have reported that they only grow on the southern face of the caucasus. the seeds differ from those of the juniper by being in small pods, like those which we see in the case of the kidney-bean; these pods when plucked before they open and dried in the sun produce what is called long pepper, but if left to open gradually, when ripe they disclose white pepper, which if afterwards dried in the sun changes colour and wrinkles up. even these products, however, have their own special infirmity, and inclement weather shrivels them up and turns the seeds into barren husks, called bregma, which is an indian word meaning 'dead.' of all kinds of pepper this is the most pungent and the lightest, and it is pale in colour. black pepper is more agreeable, but white pepper is of a milder flavour than either the black or the 'long' pepper.
