the tunny is of exceptional size; we are told of a specimen weighing a third of a ton and having a tail 3 ft. 4 in. broad. fish of no less size also occur in certain rivers, the catfish in the nile, the pike in the rhine, the sturgeon in the po, a fish that grows so fat from sloth that it sometimes reaches a thousand pounds; it is caught with a hook on a chain and only drawn out of the water by teams of oxen. and this monster is killed by the bite of a very small fish called the anchovy which goes for a particular vein in its throat with remarkable voracity. the catfish ranges about and goes for every living creature wherever it is, often dragging down horses when swimming. a fish very like a sea-pig is drawn out with teams of oxen, especially in the river moenus (main) in germany, and in the danube with weeding-hooks; an exceptionally large species with no internal framework of bones or vertebrae and very sweet flesh is recorded in the dnieper. in the ganges in india there is a fish called the platanista with a dolphin's beak and tail, but 24 ft. long. statius sebosus gives an extremely marvellous account of worms in the same river that have a pair of gills measuring 90 ft; they are deep blue in colour, and named from their appearance; he says that they are so strong that they carry off elephants coming to drink by gripping the trunk in their teeth.
