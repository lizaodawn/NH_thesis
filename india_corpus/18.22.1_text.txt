we have specified gingelly and common and italian millets as summer grains. gingelly comes from india, where it is also used for making oil; the colour of the grain is white. a grain that resembles it in asia and greece is erysimum, and the grain called with us irio would be identical with it were it not that it is more filled out, and is to be reckoned as a drug rather than a cereal. of the same nature is also the irio called in greece horminum, though it resembles cummin; it is sown with gingelly. no animal will eat either this or irio while green.
