the persian and the arabian gulfs: the sea then makes a two-fold indentations in the land upon these coasts, under the name of rubrum or "red," given to it by our countrymen; while the greeks have called it erythrum, from king erythras, or, according to some writers, from its red colour, which they think is produced by the reflection of the sun's rays; others again are of opinion that it arises from the sand and the complexion of the soil, others from some peculiarity in the nature of the water. be this as it may, this body of water is divided into two gulfs. the one which lies to the east is called the persian gulf, and is two thousand five hundred miles in circumference, according to eratosthenes. opposite to it lies arabia, the length of which is fifteen hundred miles. on the other side again, arabia is bounded by the arabian gulf. the sea as it enters this gulf is called the azanian sea. the persian gulf, at the entrance, is only five miles wide; some writers make it four. from the entrance to the very bottom of the gulf, in a straight line, has been ascertained to be nearly eleven hundred and twenty-five miles: in outline it strongly resembles the human head. onesicritus and nearchus have stated in their works that from the river indus to the persian gulf, and from thence to babylon, situate in the marshes of the euphrates, is a distance of seventeen hundred miles.
