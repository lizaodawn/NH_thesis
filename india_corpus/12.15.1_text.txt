there is also in india a grain resembling that of pepper, but larger and more brittle, called the carvophyllon, which is reported to grow on the indian lotus-tree; it is imported here for the sake of its scent. there is also a thorn-bush bearing an extremely bitter fruit that has a resemblance to pepper; this shrub has small thickly clustering leaves like the cyprus; the branches are 4 1/2 feet long, the bark of a pale colour, and the root wide-spreading and woody, of the colour of box. this root boiled in water with the seed in a copper vessel produces the medicine called lycion. the thorn in question also grows on mount pelion, where it is used for mixing with a drug, as also are the root of the asphodel, ox-gall, wormwood, sumach and the lees of olive oil. the best lycion for medicinal purposes is the kind that makes a froth; this is imported from india in leather bottles made of camel skin or rhinoceros hide. the shrub itself is sometimes known in greece under the name of chiron's buckthorn.
