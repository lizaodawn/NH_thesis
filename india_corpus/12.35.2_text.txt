the prices vary with the supply of buyers; that of staete ranges from 3 to 50 denarii a pound, whereas the top price for cultivated myrrh is 11 denarii and for erythrean 16 — this kind is passed off as arabian — and for the kernel of cave-dweller 16 1/2, but for the variety called scented myrrh 12. myrrh is adulterated with lumps of lentisk and with gum, and also with cucumber juice to give it a bitter taste, as it is with litharge of silver to increase its weight. the rest of the impurities can be detected by taste, and gum by its sticking to the teeth. but the adulteration most difficult to detect is that practised in the case of indian myrrh, which is collected in india from a certain thorn-bush; this is the only commodity imported from india that is of worse quality than that of other countries — indeed it is easily distinguished because it is so very inferior.
