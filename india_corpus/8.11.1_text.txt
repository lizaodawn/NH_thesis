elephants are produced by africa beyond the deserts of sidra and by the country of the moors; also by the land of ethiopia and the cave-dwellers, as has been said; but the biggest ones by india, as well as serpents that keep up a continual feud and warfare with them, the serpents also being of so large a size that they easily encircle the elephants in their coils and fetter them with a twisted knot. in this duel both combatants die together, and the vanquished elephant in falling crushes with its weight the snake coiled round it.
