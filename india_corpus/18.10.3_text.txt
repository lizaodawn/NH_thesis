corn is in the blade during winter; in the spring time corn of the winter variety shoots up into a stalk, but common and italian millets into a knotted hollow straw, and sesame into a stalk like fennel. the fruit of all kinds of sown grain is either contained in ears, as in the case of wheat and barley, and is protected against birds and small animals by a fence of beard, or is enclosed in pods, as with leguminous plants, or in capsules, as with gingelly and poppy. both millets are accessible also to small birds, in what can only be called joint ownership with the grower, inasmuch as they are contained in thin skins, leaving them unprotected. panic, named from its panicles or tufts, has a head that droops languidly and a stalk that tapers gradually almost into a twig; it is heaped with very closely packed grains, with a corymb that is at its longest a foot in length. in millet the hairs embracing the seed curve over with a fringed tuft. there are also varieties of panic, for instance the full-breasted kind, clustered with small tufts growing out of the ear, and with a double point; moreover these grasses are of various colours, white, black, red and even purple. bread of several kinds is made even from millet, but very little from panic; but there is no grain heavier in weight or that swells more in baking: they get sixty pounds of bread out of a peck, and a peck of porridge out of three-sixteenths of a peck soaked in water. a millet has been introduced into italy from india within the last ten years that is of a black colour, with a large grain and a stalk like that of a reed. it grows to seven feet in height, with very large hairs — they are called the mane — and is the most prolific of all kinds of corn, one grain producing three-sixteenths of a peck. it should be sown in damp ground.
