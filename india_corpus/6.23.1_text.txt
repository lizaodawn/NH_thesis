the indus: the indus, called sindis by the natives, rises in that branch of the caucasian range which bears the name of paropanisus, and runs in an easterly direction, receiving in its course the waters of nineteen rivers. the most famous of these are the hydaspes, into which four other rivers have already discharged themselves, the cantaba, which receives three other rivers, the acesinus, and the hypasis, which last two are navigable themselves. still however, so moderate, as it were, do the waters of this river show themselves in their course, that it is never more than fifty stadia in width, nor does it ever exceed fifteen paces in depth. of two islands, which it forms in its course, the one, which is known as prasiane, is of very considerable size; the other, which is smaller, is called patale. according to the accounts given by the most moderate writers, this river is navigable for a distance of twelve hundred and fifty miles, and after following the sun's course to the west, in some degree, discharges itself into the ocean. i will here give the distances of various places situate on the coast to the mouth of this river, in a general way, just as i find them stated, although they none of them tally with each other.
