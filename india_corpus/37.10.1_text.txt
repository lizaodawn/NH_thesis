the largest mass of rock-crystal ever seen by us is that which was dedicated in the capitol by livia, the wife of augustus: this weighs about 150 pounds. xenocrates, just mentioned, records that as. he saw a vessel that could hold six gallons, and some authors mention one from india with a capacity of 4 pints. what i myself can unequivocally affirm is that among the rocks of the alps it generally forms in such inaccessible places that it has to be removed by men suspended from ropes. experts are familiar with the signs that indicate its presence. pieces of rock-crystal are impaired by numerous defects, for example by rough, solder-like excrescences, cloudy spots, occlusions of moisture that are sometimes hidden within it, or hard yet brittle cores, and also what are known as 'salt-specks.' some specimens display a bright red rust, and others fibres that look like flaws. these can be concealed by the engraver. pieces, however, that have no defects are preferably left unengraved: these are known to the greeks as 'acenteta,' or 'lacking a core,' and their colour is that of clear water, not of foam. finally, the weight of a piece is a part of its value. i find that among doctors there is considered to be no more effective method of cauterizing parts that need such treatment than by means of a crystal ball so placed as to intercept the sun's rays. rock-crystal provides yet another instance of a crazy addiction, for not many years ago a respectable married woman, who was by no means rich, paid 150,000 sesterces for a single dipper.
