the nations whom it may be not altogether inopportune to mention, after passing the emodian mountains, a cross range of which is called "imaus," a word which, in the language of the natives, signifies "snowy," are the isari, the cosyri, the izi, and, upon the chain of mountains, the chisiotosagi, with numerous peoples, which have the surname of brachmanae, among whom are the maccocalingae. there are also the rivers prinas and cainas, which last flows into the ganges, both of them navigable streams. the nation of the calingae comes nearest to the sea, and above them are the mandei and the malli. in the territory of the last-named people is a mountain called mallus: the boundary of this region is the river ganges.
