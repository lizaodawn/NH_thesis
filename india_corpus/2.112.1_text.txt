our own portion of the earth, which is my subject, swims as it were in the ocean by which, as we have said, it is surrounded; its longest extent is from east to west, i.e. from india to the pillars consecrated to hercules at cadiz, a distance of 8,568 miles according to artemidorus, but 9,818 according to isidore. artemidorus adds in addition from cadiz round the sacred promontory to artabrum promontory, the longest projection of the coast of spain, 890 1/2 miles. the measurement runs by a double route; from the river ganges and its mouth where it flows into the eastern ocean, through india and parthyene to the syrian city of myriandrus situated on the issic gulf 5,215, from there by the shortest sea-route to the island of cyprus, from patara in lycia to rhodes, to the island of astypalaea in the carpathian sea, to taenarus in laconia, lilybaion in sicily, caralis in sardinia, 213, thence to cadiz 1,250, the total distance from the eastern sea making 8,568. another route, which is more certain, extends mainly overland from the ganges to the river euphrates 5,169, thence to mazaca in cappadocia 244, thence through phrygia and caria to ephesus 499, from ephesus across the aegean sea to delos 200, to the isthmus 202 1/2, thence by land and the alcyonian sea and the gulf of corinth to patras in the peloponnese 102 1/2, to leucas 87 1/2, to corcyra ditto, to acroceraunia 82 1/2, to brindisi 87 1/2, to rome 360, across the alps to the village of scingomagum 518, through gallia to the pyrenees at illiberis 456, to the ocean and the coast of spain 832, across to cadiz 7 1/2 â€” which figures by artemidorus's calculation make 8,995 miles.
