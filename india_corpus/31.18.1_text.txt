but if anybody thinks that some of these statements are incredible, he has to learn that in no sphere does nature show greater marvels, although in the early parts of my work i have mentioned plenty of examples. ctesias tells us that there is in india standing water called silasp in which nothing floats but everything sinks to the bottom; coelius says in our avernus even leaves sink, and varro that the birds that fly to it die. on the other hand, in the african lake apuscidamus everything floats and nothing sinks; similarly in the sicilian spring phinthia, as apion tells us, and among the medes in the lake and well of saturn. again, the source of the river limyra often crosses to neighbouring districts, indicating some portent, and a wonderful thing is that the fish cross with it. the inhabitants seek responses from them, offering food. to give a favourable answer the fish snap it up; but for an unfavourable one, they knock it away with their tails. the river alcas in bithynia flows by bryazus — this is the name both of a god and of his temple — the current of which perjured persons are said to be unable to endure, as it burns like a flame. in cantabria the springs of the tamaris are supposed to be prophetic. three in number they are eight feet apart, uniting in one channel to form a vast river. each one dries up for periods of twelve, occasionally of twenty days, without the slightest trace of water, although there is a copious spring near them that never dries up. it is an evil portent if those wishing to look at them find them not flowing, as recently larcius licinius, a legate pro-praetore discovered after seven days. in judea is a stream that dries up every sabbath.
