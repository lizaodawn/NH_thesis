the stone that bears the foreign name 'oica' is a pleasing mixture of black, reddish-brown, green and white. the 'ombria' ('rain stone'), otherwise known as 'notia' ('south-wind stone'), is said to fall, like the 'ceraurila' and the 'brontea,' in company with heavy rain and thunderbolts, and to have the same properties as these stones. but in addition, so we are told, it prevents offerings from being burnt away if it is placed on an altar. 'onocardia,' or 'ass's heart,' is like the scarlet kermes-insect in colour, but we are told nothing further. 'oritis,' or 'mountain stone,' sometimes known also as 'sideritis,' 'iron stone,' is spherical in shape and not affected by fire. 'ostracias,' or 'sherd stone,' otherwise known as 'ostracitis,' resembles earthenware, but is harder than 'ceramitis.' it is like agate except that the latter has a greasy appearance when it has been polished. this 'ostracias' is so hard that other gemstones are engraved with pieces of it. the 'ostritis,' or 'oyster stone,' owes its name to its resemblance to an oyster-shell. 'ophicardelos' is the foreign name for a black stone that is encircled by two white bands. obsidian has already been discussed by me in an earlier book. there are also found gems bearing this same name and colour not merely in ethiopia and india but also in samnium and, as some people think, in spain on the shores of the atlantic.
