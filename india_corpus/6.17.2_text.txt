joining up to adiabene are the people formerly known as the 'carduchi,' now the cordueni, in front of whom the river tigris flows: and next to them are the pratitae, entitled the par odon, who hold possession of the caspian gates. on the other side of these gates we come to the deserts of parthia and the mountain chain of cithenus; and after that, the most pleasant locality of all parthia, choara by name. here were two cities of the parthians, built in former times for their protection against the people of media, calliope, and issatis, the last of which stood formerly on a rock. hecatompylos, the capital of parthia, is distant from the caspian gates one hundred and thirty-three miles. in such an effectual manner is the kingdom of parthia shut out by these passes. after leaving these gates we find the nation of the caspii, extending as far as the shores of the caspian, a race which has given its name to these gates as well as to the sea: on the left there is a mountainous district. turning back from this nation to the river cyrus, the distance is said to be two hundred and twenty miles; but if we go from that river as far down as the caspian gates, the distance is seven hundreds miles. in the itineraries of alexander the great these gates were made the central or turning point in his expeditions; the distance from the caspian gates to the frontier of india being there set down as fifteen thousand six hundred and eighty stadia, to the city of bactra, commonly called zariaspa, three thousand seven hundred, and thence to the river jaxartes five thousand stadia.
