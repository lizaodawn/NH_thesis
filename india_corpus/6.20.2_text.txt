the first people that are known of here are the seres, so famous for the wool that is found in their forests. after steeping it in water, they comb off a white down that adheres to the leaves; and then to the females of our part of the world they give the twofold task of unravelling their textures, and of weaving the threads afresh. so manifold is the labour, and so distant are the regions which are thus ransacked to supply a dress through which our ladies may in public display their charms. the seres are of inoffensive manners, but, bearing a strong resemblance therein to all savage nations, they shun all intercourse with the rest of mankind, and await the approach of those who wish to traffic with them. the first river that is known in their territory is the psitharas, next to that the cambari, and the third the laros; after which we come to the promontory of chryse, the gulf of cynaba, the river atianos, and the nation of the attacori on the gulf of that name, a people protected by their sunny hills from all noxious blasts, and living in a climate of the same temperature as that of the hyperborei. amometus has written a work entirely devoted to the history of these people, just as hecataeus has done in his treatise on the hyperborei. after the attacori, we find the nations of the phruri and the tochari, and, in the interior, the casiri, a people of india, who look toward the scythians, and feed on human flesh. here are also numerous wandering nomad tribes of india. there are some authors who state that in a north-easterly direction these nations touch upon the cicones and the brysari.
