but the largest number of animals and those of the largest size are in the indian sea, among them whales covering three acres each, and sharks 100 ells long: in fact in those regions lobsters grow to 6 ft. long, and also eels in the river ganges to 300 ft. the monsters in the sea are mostly to be seen about the solstices. at those periods in that part of the world there are rushing whirlwinds and rainstorms and tempests hurtling down from the mountain ridges that upturn the seas from their bottom, and roll with their waves monsters forced up from the depths in such a multitude, like the shoals of tunnies in other places, that the fleet of alexander the great deployed its column in line of battle to encounter them, in the same way as if an enemy force were meeting it: it was not possible to escape them in any other manner. they are not scared by shouts or noises or uproar, but only by impact, and they are only routed by a violent collision. there is an enormous peninsula in the red sea called cadara, the projection of which forms a vast bay which took king ptolemy twelve days and nights of rowing to cross, as it does not admit a breath of wind from any quarter. in this tranquil retreat particularly the creatures grow to a huge motionless bulk. the admirals of the fleets of alexander the great have stated that the gedrosi who live by the river arabis make the doorways in their houses out of the monsters' jaws and use their bones for roof-beams, many of them having been found that were 60 ft. long. also great creatures resembling sheep come out on to the land in that country and after grazing on the roots of bushes return; and there are some with the heads of horses, asses and bulls that eat up the crops.
