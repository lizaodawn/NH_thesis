also a linen has now been invented that is incombustible, it is called 'live' linen, and i have seen napkins made of it glowing on the hearth at banquets and burnt more brilliantly clean by the fire than they could be by being washed in water. this linen is used for making shrouds for royalty which keep the ashes of the corpse separate from the rest of the pyre. the plants grows in the deserts and sun-scorched regions of india where no rain falls, the haunts of deadly snakes, and it is habituated to living in burning heat; it is rarely found, and is difficult to weave into cloth because of its shortness; its colour is normally red but turns white by the action of fire. when any of it is found, it rivals the prices of exceptionally fine pearls. the greek name for it is asbestinon, derived from its peculiar property. anaxilaus states that if this linen is wrapped round a tree it can be felled without the blows being heard, as it deadens their sound. consequently this kind of linen holds the highest rank in the whole of the world. the next place belongs to a fabric made of fine flax grown in the neighbourhood of elis in achaia, and chiefly used for women's finery; i find that it formerly changed hands at the price of gold, four denarii for one twenty-fourth of an ounce. the nap of linen cloths, principally that obtained from the sails of seagoing ships, is much used as a medicine, and its ash has the efficacy of metal dross. among the poppies also there is a kind from which an outstanding material for bleaching linen is extracted.
