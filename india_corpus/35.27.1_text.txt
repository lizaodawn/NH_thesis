of next greatest importance after this is indigo, a product of india, being a slime that adheres to the scum upon reeds. when it is sifted out it is black, but in dilution it yields a marvellous mixture of purple and blue. there is another kind of it that floats on the surface of the pans in the purple dye-shops, and this is the 'scum of purple.' people who adulterate it stain pigeons' droppings with genuine indigo, or else colour earth of selinus or ring-earth with woad. it can be tested by means of a live coal, as if genuine it gives off a brilliant purple flame and a smell of the sea while it smokes; on this account some people think that it is collected from rocks on the coast. the price of indigo is 20 denarii per pound. used medicinally it allays cramps and fits and dries up sores.
