ethiopia produces elephants that rival those of india, being 30 ft. high; the only surprising thing is what led juba to believe them to be crested. the ethiopian tribe in whose country they are chiefly bred are called the asachaeans; it is stated that in the coast districts belonging to this tribe the elephants link themselves four or five together into a sort of raft and holding up their heads to serve as sails are carried on the waves to the better pastures of arabia.
