now that i have completed my account of the natural qualities of aquatic plants and animals, it seems to me not foreign to my purpose to point out that, throughout all the seas which are so numerous and spacious and come flooding into the landmass over so many miles and surround it outside to an extent which might be thought of as almost equal to that of the world itself — there are one hundred and forty-four species in all; and that they can be included each under its own name, a thing which, in the case of creatures of the land and those which fly, cannot be done. for in fact we do not know all the wild animals and flying creatures of india and ethiopia and syria; while even of mankind itself the varieties which we have been able to discover are the greatest in number by far. add to this ceylon and various other islands of the ocean about which fabulous tales are told. surely it will be agreed that not all the species can be brought under one general view for our consideration. on the other hand, upon my solemn word, in the sea, vast though it is, and in the ocean, the number of animals produced is known; and — we may well wonder at this — we are better acquainted with the things which nature has sunk down in the deep.
