africa almost alone does not produce stags, but africa also has the chameleon, although india produces it in greater numbers. its shape and size were those of a lizard, were not the legs straight and longer. the flanks are joined on to the belly as in fishes, and the spine projects in a similar manner. it has a snout not unlike a pig's, considering its small size, a very long tail that tapers towards the end and curls in coils like a viper, and crooked talons; it moves rather slowly like a tortoise and has a rough body like a crocodile's, and eyes in a hollow recess, close together and very large and of the same colours as its body. it never shuts its eyes, and looks round not by moving the pupil but by turning the whole eye. it holds itself erect with its mouth always wide open, and it is the only animal that does not live on food or drink or anything else but the nutriment that it derives from the air, with a gape that is almost terrifying, but otherwise it is harmless. and it is more remarkable for the nature of its colouring, since it constantly changes the hue of its eyes and tail and whole body and always makes it the colour with which it is in closest contact, except red and white. when dead it is of a pallid colour.
