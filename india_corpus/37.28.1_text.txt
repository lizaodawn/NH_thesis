a stone that is closely akin to 'carbonculi' is the 'sandastros,' sometimes known also as the garamantic stone in virtue of its character. it occurs in a part of india that hears the same name, and is found also in southern arabia. its chief merit is that its fiery brilliance, displayed, as it were, in a transparent casing, glitters with golden particles that shine like stars within the stone, and always inside its structure and never upon its surface. furthermore, there are religious associations attached to these stones, and we are told of their affinity with the stars, which exists because the starry particles with which they are embellished generally conform in their numbers and arrangement to the constellations of the pleiades and hyades. for this reason, they are regarded by astrologers as ritual objects. here too, the male stones may be distinguished by their deep colour and by a certain vitality, which imparts a tint to objects placed close to them. the indian stones, it is said, even weaken the sight. the fire of the female stones is more mellow, and glows rather than kindles. some prefer the arabian stones to the indian, and compare the former to the smoky 'chrysolithus.' ismenias declares that because of its softness the 'sandastros' cannot be polished, and so fails to fetch a high price. some people call the stone 'sandrisites.' what is universally agreed is that, the larger the number of starry particles, the higher the price. sometimes misunderstanding is caused by the similarity of the term 'sandaresus,' applied to a stone which nicander calls 'sandaserion' and others 'sandaresos,' although there are certain writers who actually call this stone 'sandastros,' and our former stone 'sandaresus.' this latter stone likewise is found in india and preserves the name of its place of origin. its colour is that of a green apple or green oil, and it is generally despised!
