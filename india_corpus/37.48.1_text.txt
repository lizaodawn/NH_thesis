a similarly bright colourless stone is the 'astrion,' or 'little star,' which closely resembles rock-crystal, and occurs in india and on the coasts of patalene. it has inside it at the centre a star shining brightly like the full moon. the name is sometimes explained by the fact that the stone, when held up to the stars, is supposed to catch their glitter and reflect it. it is said that the best variety is found in carmania, and that no kind of gem is less liable to possess defects. we are told that there is also a variety known as 'ceraunia,' or 'thunder-stone,' which is inferior, and that the worst of all recalls the glimmer of a lantern.
