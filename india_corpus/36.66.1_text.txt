next, as was to be expected, man's inventive skill was no longer content to mix only soda with the sand. he began to introduce the magnet stone also, since there is a belief that it attracts to itself molten glass no less than iron. similarly, lustrous stones of many kinds came to be burnt with the melt and, then again, shells and quarry sand. authorities state that in india glass is made also of broken rock-crystal and that for this reason no glass can compare with that of india. to resume, a fire of light, dry wood is used for preparing the melt, to which are added copper and soda, preferably egyptian soda. glass, like copper, is smelted in a series of furnaces, and dull black lumps are formed. molten glass is everywhere so sharp that, before there is the least sensation, it cuts to the bone any part of the body on which it splutters. after being reduced to lumps, the glass is again fused in the workshop and is tinted. some of it is shaped by blowing, some machined on a lathe and some chased like silver. sidon was once famous for its glassworks, since, apart from other achievements, glass mirrors were invented there.
