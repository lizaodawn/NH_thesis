but first there are some other islands of which we must make mention. patala, as we have already stated, lies at the mouth of the indus: it is of a triangular figure, and is two hundred and twenty miles in breadth. beyond the mouth of the indus are the islands of chryse and argyre, abounding in metals, i believe; but as to what some persons have stated, that their soil consists of gold and silver, i am not so willing to give a ready credence to that. after passing these islands we come to crocala, twenty miles in breadth, and then, at twelve miles' distance from it, bibraga, abounding in oysters and other bell-fish. at eight miles' distance from bibraga we find toralliba, and many others of no note.
