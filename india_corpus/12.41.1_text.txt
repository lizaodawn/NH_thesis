these people have not got cinnamon or casia, and nevertheless arabia is styled 'happy' — a country with a false and ungrateful appellation, as she puts her happiness to the credit of the powers above, although she owes more of it to the power below. her good fortune has been caused by the luxury of mankind even in the hour of death, when they burn over the departed the products which they had originally understood to have been created for the gods. good authorities declare that arabia does not produce so large a quantity of perfume in a year's output as was burned by the emperor nero in a day at the obsequies of his consort poppaea. then reckon up the vast number of funerals celebrated yearly throughout the entire world, and the perfumes such as are given to the gods a grain at a time, that are piled up in heaps to the honour of dead bodies. yet the gods used not to regard with less favour the worshippers who petitioned them with salted spelt, but rather, as the facts show, they were more benevolent in those days. but the title 'happy' belongs still more to the arabian sea, for from it come the pearls which that country sends us. and by the lowest reckoning india, china and the arabian peninsula take from our empire 100 million sesterces every year — that is the sum which our luxuries and our women cost us; for what fraction of these imports, i ask you, now goes to the gods or to the powers of the lower world?
