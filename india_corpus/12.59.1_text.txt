syria also supplies the malobathrum, a tree with a folded leaf, the colour of a leaf that has dried up; from it oil is pressed to use for unguents, egypt also producing it in still greater quantity. but the kind that comes from india is valued more highly; it is said to grow there in marshes, like the lentil, with a scent stronger than that of saffron, a darkish rough appearance, and a sort of salt taste. the white variety is less highly spoken of; it very quickly acquires a musty smell with age. malobathrum when placed under the tongue ought to taste like nard; but its scent when it is put in slightly warmed wine surpasses any others. in point of price at all events it approaches the marvellous, the pound ranging from one denarius to four hundred, while the leaf itself reaches 60 denarii a pound.
