the porcupine is a native of india and africa. it is covered with a prickly skin of the hedgehogs' kind, but the spines of the porcupine are longer and they dart out when it draws the skin tight: it pierces the mouths of hounds when they close with it, and shoots out at them when further off. in the winter months it hibernates, as is the nature of many animals and before all of bears.
