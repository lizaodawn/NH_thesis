next among the bright colourless stones is the 'asteria,' or 'star stone,' which holds its high position owing to a natural peculiarity, in that a light is enclosed in it, stored in something resembling the pupil of the eye. this light is transmitted and, as the stone is tilted, is displayed successively in different places, as if capable of locomotion within. when it is held up to the sun the same stone reflects bright beams radiating as if from a star; and thus it has acquired its name. the stones found in india are difficult to engrave, and those from carmania are preferred.
