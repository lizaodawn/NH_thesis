after passing the nations in the vicinity of the indus, we come to the mountain districts. the territory of capisene formerly had a city, called capisa, which was destroyed by cyrus. arachosia has a river and a city of the same name; the city was built by semiramis; by some writers it is called cophen. the river erymanthus flows past parabeste, which belongs to the arachosii. writers make the dexendrusi come next, forming the boundary of the arachotae on the southern side, and of the paropanisadae on the north. the city of cartana lies at the foot of caucasus; in later times it has been called tetragonis. this region lies over against that of the bactri, who come next, and whose chief city is alexandria, so called from the name of its founder. we then come to the syndraci, the dangalae the parapinae, the catuces, and the mazi; and then at the foot of caucasus, to the cadrusi, whose town was built by alexander.
