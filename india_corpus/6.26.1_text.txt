voyages to india: but before we enter into any details respecting these countries, it will be as well to mention what onesicritus has stated, who commanded the fleet of alexander, and sailed from india into the heart of persia, and what has been more recently related by juba; after which i shall speak of the route along these seas which has been discovered in later years, and is followed at the present day. the journal of the voyage of onesicritus and nearchus has neither the names of the stations, nor yet the distances set down in it; and first of all, it is not sufficiently explained where xylenepolis was, and near what river, a place founded by alexander, and from which, upon setting out, they took their departure. still, however, the following places are mentioned by them, which are worthy of our notice. the town of arbis, founded by nearchus on the occasion of this voyage; the river nabrus, navigable for vessels, and opposite to it an island, at a distance of seventy stadia; alexandria, built by leonnatus by order of alexander in the territories of this people; argenus, with a very convenient harbour; the river tonberos, a navigable stream, around whose banks are the pasirae; then come the ichthyophagi, who extend over so large a tract of coast that it took thirty days to sail past their territory; and an island known by the names of the "island of the sun" and the "bed of the nymphs," the earth of which is red, and in which every animal instantly dies; the cause of which, however, has not been ascertained. next to these is the nation of the ori, and then the hyctanis, a river of carmania, with an excellent harbour at its mouth, and producing gold; at this spot the writers state that for the first time they caught sight of the great bear. the star arcturus too, they tell us, was not to be seen here every night, and never, when it was seen, during the whole of it. up to this spot extended the empire of the achaemenidae, and in these districts are to be found mines of copper, iron, arsenic, and red lead.
