the peoples of the east employ reeds in making war; by means of reeds with a feather added to them. they hasten the approach of death, and to reeds they add points which deal wounds with their barb that cannot be extracted, and if the weapon itself breaks in the wound, another weapon is made out of it. with these weapons they obscure the very rays of the sun, and this is what chiefly makes them want calm weather and hate wind and rain, which compel the combatants to keep peace between them. and if anybody should make a rather careful reckoning of the ethiopians, egyptians, arabs, indians, scythians and bactrians, and the numerous races of the sarmatians and of the east, and all the realms of the parthians, almost one-half of mankind in the whole world lives subject to the sway of the reed. it was outstanding skill in this employment of the reed in crete that made her warriors famous; but in this also, as in all other things, italy has won the victory, as no reed is more suitable for arrows than that which grows in the river at bononia, the reno, which contains the largest amount of pith and has a good flying weight and a balance that offers a sturdy resistance even to gusts of wind â€” an attraction which does not belong in the same degree to the shafts grown in belgium. the reeds of crete also have the same valuable property, although those from india are placed highest of all, some people believing that they belong to a different species, as with the addition of points they also serve the purpose of lances. the indian bamboo indeed is of the size of a tree, as we see in the case of the specimens frequently found in our temples. the indians say that in this plant also there is a difference between males and females, the male having a more compact body and the female a bulkier one. and a single length between knots, if we can believe it, will actually serve as a boat. the bamboo grows especially on the banks of the river chenab.
