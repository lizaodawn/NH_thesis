flax is chiefly grown in sandy soils, and with a single ploughing. no other plant grows more quickly: it is sown in spring and plucked in summer, and owing to this also it does damage to the land. nevertheless, one might forgive egypt for growing it to enable her to import the merchandise of arabia and india. really? and are the gallic provinces also assessed on such revenue as this? and is it not enough that they have the mountains separating them from the sea, and that on the side of the ocean they are bounded by an actual vacuum, as the term is? the cadurci, caleti, ruteni, bituriges, and the morini who are believed to be the remotest of mankind, in fact the whole of the gallic provinces, weave sailcloth, and indeed by this time so do even our enemies across the rhine, and linen is the showiest dress-material known to their womankind. this reminds us of the fact recorded by varro that it is a clan-custom in the family of the serrani for the women not to wear linen dresses. in germany the women carry on this manufacture in caves dug underground; and similarly also in the alia district of italy between the po and the ticinus, where the linen wins the prize as the third best in europe, that of saetabis being first, as the second prize is won by the linens of retovium near the alia district and faventia on the aemilian road. the faventia linens are preferred for whiteness to those of alia, which are always unbleached, but those of retovium are supremely fine in texture and substance and are as white as the faventia, but have no nap, which quality counts in their favour with some people but puts off others. this flax makes a tough thread having a quality almost more uniform than that of a spider's web, and giving a twang when you choose to test it with your teeth; consequently it is twice the price of the other kinds.
