similarly it is reported that at the town of syene, 5000 stades south of alexandria, at noon in midsummer no shadow is cast, and that in a well made for the sake of testing this the light reaches to the bottom, clearly showing that the sun is vertically above that place at the time; and this is stated in the writings of onesicritus also to occur at the same time in india south of the river hypasis. it is also stated that in the cave-dwellers' city of berenice, and 4820 stades away at the town of ptolemais in the same tribe, which was founded on the shore of the red sea for the earliest elephant hunts, the same thing occurs 45 days before and 45 days after midsummer, and during that period of 90 days the shadows are thrown southward. again in meroe — this is an inhabited island in the river nile 5000 stades from syene, and is the capital of the aethiopian race — the shadows disappear twice a year, when the sun is in the 18th degree of taurus and in the 14th of leo. there is a mountain named maleus in the indian tribe of the oretes, near which shadows are thrown southward in summer and northward in winter; the northern constellation is visible there on only 15 nights. also in india at the well-known port of patala the sun rises on the right and shadows fall southward. it was noticed when alexander was staying at this place that the great and little bears were visible only in the early part of the night. alexander's guide onesicritus wrote that this constellation is not visible at the places in india where there are no shadows, and that these places are called shadeless, and no reckoning is kept of the hours there.
