however, that we may come to a better understanding relative to the description of these regions, we will follow in the track of alexander the great. diognetus and baeton, whose duty it was to ascertain the distances and length of his expeditions, have written that from the caspian gates to hecatompylon, the city of the parthians, the distance is the number of miles which we have already stated; and that from thence to alexandria, of the arii, which city was founded by the same king, the distance is five hundred and seventy-five miles; from thence to prophthasia, the city of the drangae, one hundred and ninety-nine; from thence to the city of the arachosii, five hundred and sixty-five; from thence to ortospanum, one hundred and seventy-five; and from thence to the city built by alexander, fifty, miles. in some copies, however, the numbers are found differently stated; and we find this last city even placed at the very foot of mount caucasus! from this place to the river cophes and peucolaitis, a city of india, is two hundred and thirty-seven miles; from thence to the river indus and the city of taxilla sixty; from thence to the famous river hydaspes one hundred and twenty; and from thence to the hypasis, a river no less famous, two hundred and ninety miles, and three hundred and ninety paces. this last was the extreme limit of the expedition of alexander, though he crossed the river and dedicated certain altars on the opposite side. the dispatches written by order of that king fully agree with the distances above stated.
