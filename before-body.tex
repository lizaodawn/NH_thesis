This thesis aims to explore the first encyclopedia of the ancient world using digital methods within the scope of spatial humanities. Through a combination of skills acquired in the Digital Humanities programme - such as textual analysis, network analysis and data visualisation - and the integration of markup languages for interactive presentations, I have gained valuable training in conducting insightful digital humanities research.

Writing this thesis has been both an enjoyable journey through Pliny's encyclopaedic landscape and a fulfilling exploration of digital methods. Throughout this journey, I deeply appreciate the extensive guidance and encouragement of my supervisor, Professor Margherita Fantoli, and my daily advisor, Laura Soffiantini. Professor Fantoli's constant notes to "have fun" during classes, assignments and events have left a lasting impression. They reflect the joy of exploring and overcoming challenges, and motivate me to continue to delve into the field of DH. Discussions with Laura were enlightening; her inspiring instructions and technical mentoring were invaluable to the progress I have achieved.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my dear family and friends for their continuous care, understanding and tender support.

This study examines Pliny's \textit{Natural History} from a spatial perspective, focusing on the content relating to India and incorporating the digitised and annotated text available in the \href{https://topostext.org/}{TOPOSText project}. The research employs a variety of methodologies, including word frequency and collocation analysis, topic modelling and network analysis, with an integration of close reading practices.
      
The multifaceted role that India plays in the narrative is highlighted in the study's findings. It emerges not only as a geographical counterpart and repository of precious treasures, but also as an important trading partner of the Roman Empire and the Mediterranean, a context closely related to Pliny's Stoic perspective on the natural world. In addition, the creation of a network map linking place and person names associated with India highlights the clustering of historical figures in the content structure.
