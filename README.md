# Intro
This repository contains the code, the sparsed data, the generated dataset and the visualisation output of my master's thesis, entitled "Mapping India in Pliny the Elder's Natural History". 

The study examines Plinyâ€™s Natural History from a spatial perspective, focusing on the content relating to India and incorporating the digitised and annotated text available in the TOPOSText project. The research employs a variety of methodologies, including word frequency and collocation analysis, topic modelling and network analysis, with integration of close reading practices.
